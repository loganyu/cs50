0.  How many different colors does each format support? BMP: 16,777,216; GIF: 256; JPEG: 16.7 million; PNG: over 16 million
1.  Which of these formats supports animation? GIF
2.  What’s the difference between lossy and lossless compression? Lossless recreates file exactly. Lossy eliminates "unnecessary" bits.
3.  Which of these formats is lossy-compressed? JPEG
4.  What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system? The filename's first character is changed to indicate it has been deleted. The file's FAT clusters are moved to the hard drive's list of free clusters.
5.  What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered? Overriding the file.
6.  What’s stdint.h? A library of integer types.
7.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program? As an alias for primitive C/C++ datatypes.
8.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively? (Assume a 32-bit architecture like the CS50 Appliance.) 1, 4, 4, 2
9.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? (Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers.)" 66 ('B'), 77 ('M')
10. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize? bfSize- size of whole file. biSize- size of header
11. What does it mean if biHeight is negative? Bitmap is top down.
12. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)? biBitCount
13. Why might fopen return NULL in copy.c:37? name is not allowed
14. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code? in loop, we are reading one element at a time
15. What value does copy.c:70 assign padding if bi.biWidth is 3? 4
16. What does fseek do? sets the file position
17. What is SEEK_CUR? seek from current location
18. Whodunit? Mila Banana
